# Why Music Theory?
Music is a beautiful form of art, that has evolved over decades, and formed recurring patterns.
Music theory gives us the tools and techniques to provide a structured and progressive roadmap to understand what we hear and play.
I aim to teach ~~not so~~ "advanced" concepts intuitively to "complete beginners", who very very recently (if even) picked up their instrument for the first time.
If you want to play jazz/funk/sophisticated genres, understand how music is constructed or avoid rote learning unnecessarily, read on.
This is for everyone who like me struggles to digest the plethora of information out there.

Let's pull down the curtains, remove the veil and stop with the gatekeeping, you don't need to spend four years studying blues before you progress to learn jazz - that is an utterly ridiculous joke that I refuse to listen to.
I began understanding theory and became able to hear scale degrees within weeks of learning guitar.
I might not be a music school junkie genius but nonetheless, I think a regular driven person's take on music theory might be helpful for a good deal of people like me.
Theory should be taught as Lego blocks that click together, not large already half-built houses used to construct a dam.

# Why *this* Guide?
Most articles, textbooks or videos fall into three broad categories:
1. Generic theory, notational or piano-driven learning
2. Traditional guitar theory but with isolated exercises
3. Non-beginner friendly theory applied to the guitar

I know this because I have been in struggle town sifting through anything that could remotely help me even just a little bit.
These are by no means bad content, on the contrary, I consider them important enough to often link to.
This guide fills in the gaps, to provide:
* Holistic overview of **where theory is used**
* **Easy explanations** of frequently used theory topics (including diagrams)
* **How to learn theory** (in the context of _the fretboard_)
* **Curated optional resources** such as **YouTube videos and apps**

Feel free to progress through this article at your own pace, but it's intended to be consumable in a single day.
I implore you to subsequently consider how you want to practice and learn the content.
I provide or link to exercises for everything, but feel free to find alternatives elsewhere, or come up with them yourself!
Rereading is helpful but hopefully not 100% critical per se if the additional resources are used.
