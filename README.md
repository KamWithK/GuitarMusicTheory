# Why Music Theory?
Music is a beautiful form of art, that has evolved over decades, and formed recurring patterns.
Music theory gives us the tools and techniques to provide a structured and progressive roadmap to understand what we hear and play.
I am curating resources and providing beginner explanations of ~~not so~~ "advanced" concepts in a more intuitivelylight than you might normally see.
This is for everyone who like me struggles to digest the plethora of information out there, but just want to learn to play Jazz, Funk or whatever music you love most.

I started learning theory right off the bat because I have always passionately listened to Jazz, and wanted to get started straight away.
I wanted actionable exercises focused around the skills needed to teach myself tunes, which I would like to share.
A lot of hard work is always needed, but I hope this can help void the three or four years of pre-learning some Redditor's may advise.
