# Why Music Theory?
Theory gives us the tools and techniques to slowly understand and piece together the building blocks form the music we hear and play.
I am curating resources and providing beginner explanations of ~~not so~~ "advanced" concepts, so anyone can start their journey.

I started learning theory right off the bat because I have always passionately listened to Jazz, and wanted to get going straight away.
I wanted actionable exercises focused around the skills needed to teach myself tunes which I would like to share.
A lot of hard work is always needed, but I hope this can help both me and you void the three or four years of pre-learning some Redditors may advise.
The theory is biased towards Jazz because that is what I am most passionate about, but the same topics should be more broadly applicable to other genres too.

# Included Content
* Holistic overview of **where theory is used**
* **Simplified explanations** of frequently used theory topics
* **How to learn theory** (in the context of _the fretboard_, with diagrams and exercises)
* **Curated resources** such as _videos and apps_, from reputable teachers

Over time, until I feel satisfied with my progress and able to learn most of the songs I desire, I will hopefully keep adding to this.
